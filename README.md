# probability-puzzlers-paul-j-nahin
Paul J Nahin has written a beautiful book on probability - "Duelling Idiots and Other Probability Puzzlers". The book contains matlab codes as solutions to the posed scenarios. I am going to practise them in this repository. I will also try to achieve the same result using python.
